Upon completing the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification, there are 5 projects. You are viewing the last, final project- a personal portfolio site.

I've created a website with a hero section introducing me, then a project gallery section, and lastly, a contact section. This website meets the requirements in the user stories put forth in the assignment.

The site is deployed with Netlify and the contact form sends a message that's forwarded to my personal email. Feel free to send me feedback or comments. Thanks for viewing my work.
